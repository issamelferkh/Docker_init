- Q25 Lst all services on local swarm -> ```docker service ls```: where is swarm ???





From the shell of a debian container, 
install via the container’s package manager everything you need to 
compile C source code 
push it onto a git repo 
package manager + packages already in the container are updated
For this exercise, you should only specify the commands to be run directly in the container.

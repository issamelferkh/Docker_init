- Q25 Lst all services on local swarm -> ```docker service ls```: where is swarm ???





From the shell of a debian container, install via the containerâ€™s package manager
everything you need to compile C source code 
push it onto a git repo (of course, make sure before that the package manager and the packages already in the container are updated). 
For this exercise, you should only specify the commands to be run directly in the container.
